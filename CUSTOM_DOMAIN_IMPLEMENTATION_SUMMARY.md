# üåê Custom Domain Implementation Summary

## üìã Overview

**YES, it is absolutely possible** to use `prs.citylandcondo.com` as a custom domain with automated Let's Encrypt SSL certificates, even with GoDaddy hosting (no API access) and office-network-only accessibility.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### **Primary Approach: HTTP-01 Challenge with Temporary Port Forwarding**

This solution works by temporarily exposing port 80 during certificate generation (every ~90 days) while maintaining security for daily operations.

## üéØ Key Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Automated SSL**: Let's Encrypt certificates with 90-day auto-renewal
- ‚úÖ **GoDaddy Compatible**: Works without API access - only requires DNS A record
- ‚úÖ **Office Network Only**: Domain only accessible from internal network
- ‚úÖ **Minimal Maintenance**: Quarterly renewal process (5-10 minutes)
- ‚úÖ **Professional Appearance**: Custom branded domain for users
- ‚úÖ **Security Maintained**: HTTPS with valid certificates

## üîß Implementation Components

### 1. **Automated Scripts Created**
- `ssl-automation-citylandcondo.sh` - Complete SSL certificate automation
- `ssl-renewal-monitor.sh` - Daily monitoring and alerting
- `setup-custom-domain.sh` - One-click setup wizard

### 2. **Nginx Configuration Updated**
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- Custom domain handling
- IP fallback access
- Security headers added

### 3. **Monitoring System**
- Daily certificate status checks
- Email alerts 30 days before expiry
- Grafana webhook integration
- Automated renewal reminders

## üöÄ Quick Implementation

### **One-Command Setup**
```bash
sudo /opt/prs/prod-workplan/scripts/setup-custom-domain.sh
```

This script handles:
1. ‚úÖ Prerequisites check
2. ‚úÖ Package installation
3. ‚úÖ DNS configuration guidance
4. ‚úÖ SSL certificate generation
5. ‚úÖ Service configuration
6. ‚úÖ Monitoring setup

### **Manual Steps Required**
1. **DNS Configuration** (One-time)
   - Add A record in GoDaddy: `prs` ‚Üí `[Office Public IP]`
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for propagation

2. **Port Forwarding** (During certificate generation only)
   - Forward port 80 to 192.168.0.100:80
   - Remove forwarding after certificate generation

## üìÖ Operational Process

### **Initial Setup** (One-time, ~30 minutes)
1. Configure DNS A record in GoDaddy
2. Run setup script
3. Follow guided prompts
4. Test access from office devices

### **Quarterly Renewal** (~5-10 minutes)
1. Receive automated email alert
2. Enable port 80 forwarding temporarily
3. Run: `sudo /opt/prs/scripts/ssl-automation-citylandcondo.sh renew`
4. Disable port 80 forwarding
5. Verify certificate renewal

### **Daily Operations** (Automated)
- Certificate monitoring at 2:00 AM
- Health checks and alerts
- Log rotation and maintenance

## üîê Security Considerations

### **Network Security**
- Port 80 forwarding only needed during certificate generation
- HTTPS (port 443) can remain permanently forwarded
- Domain only accessible from office network
- All traffic encrypted with valid SSL certificates

### **Certificate Security**
- Private keys protected with proper permissions
- Certificates backed up to NAS automatically
- Monitoring prevents expiration
- Let's Encrypt provides industry-standard security

## üéØ User Experience

### **Before Implementation**
- Access via IP: `https://192.168.0.100`
- Self-signed certificate warnings
- Technical appearance

### **After Implementation**
- Access via domain: `https://prs.citylandcondo.com`
- Valid SSL certificate (no warnings)
- Professional branded appearance
- Same performance and functionality
