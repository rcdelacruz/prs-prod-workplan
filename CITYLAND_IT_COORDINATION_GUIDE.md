# ü§ù Cityland IT Network Admin Coordination Guide

## üìã Overview

This guide provides specific instructions for the Cityland IT network admin to support the `prs.citylandcondo.com` implementation with automated SSL certificates.

## üéØ Your Role in the Implementation

As the Cityland IT network admin managing GoDaddy DNS, you'll need to:

1. **Create one DNS A record** in GoDaddy (one-time setup)
2. **Assist with port forwarding** during certificate generation (quarterly, 5-10 minutes)
3. **Optional**: Configure internal DNS for better performance

## üìã Required Actions

### **Action 1: GoDaddy DNS Configuration (One-time)**

#### Login to GoDaddy DNS Management
1. Log into your GoDaddy account
2. Navigate to "My Products" ‚Üí "DNS"
3. Select the `citylandcondo.com` domain

#### Create DNS A Record
```
Record Type: A
Name: prs
Value: [Your office public IP address]
TTL: 1 Hour (3600 seconds)
```

**Important**: Replace `[Your office public IP address]` with your actual public IP

#### Verification
After creating the record, test with:
```bash
nslookup prs.citylandcondo.com 8.8.8.8
```

### **Action 2: Router/Firewall Port Forwarding**

#### When Needed
- **Initial Setup**: During first certificate generation
- **Renewals**: Every ~90 days (you'll receive email notification)
- **Duration**: 5-10 minutes each time

#### Port Forwarding Configuration
```
External Port: 80
Internal IP: 192.168.0.100
Internal Port: 80
Protocol: TCP
```

#### Process
1. **Enable**: Add port forwarding rule before certificate generation
2. **Generate**: Certificate generation process (automated)
3. **Disable**: Remove port forwarding rule after completion

### **Action 3: Internal DNS Configuration (Optional but Recommended)**

#### Benefits
- Faster access for office users
- Reduced external traffic
- Better performance

#### Configuration
Add internal DNS record:
```
Record Type: A
Name: prs.citylandcondo.com
Value: 192.168.0.100
```

## üìÖ Implementation Timeline

### **Phase 1: Initial Setup (Day 1)**

#### Your Tasks (15 minutes)
1. **GoDaddy DNS**: Create A record for `prs.citylandcondo.com`
2. **Internal DNS**: Configure internal record (optional)
3. **Verification**: Test DNS resolution

#### Coordination
- **Before**: Confirm your office public IP address
- **After**: Notify technical team when DNS is configured

### **Phase 2: Certificate Generation (Day 2)**

#### Your Tasks (10 minutes)
1. **Port Forwarding**: Enable temporary rule
2. **Monitoring**: Confirm certificate generation completes
3. **Security**: Disable port forwarding rule

#### Coordination
- **Before**: Technical team will notify you when ready
- **During**: Be available for 10-15 minutes
- **After**: Confirm port forwarding is disabled

### **Phase 3: Testing (Day 3)**

#### Your Tasks (5 minutes)
1. **DNS Testing**: Verify both external and internal resolution
2. **Access Testing**: Test HTTPS access from office devices
3. **Documentation**: Note any network-specific configurations

## üîÑ Ongoing Operations

### **Quarterly Certificate Renewal**

#### Notification Process
You'll receive an email notification 30 days before certificate expiry:

```
Subject: SSL Certificate Renewal Required - prs.citylandcondo.com
Content: Certificate expires in 30 days. Please coordinate renewal.
```

#### Renewal Process (5-10 minutes)
1. **Schedule**: Coordinate brief maintenance window
2. **Enable**: Add port 80 forwarding rule
3. **Execute**: Technical team runs renewal script
4. **Disable**: Remove port 80 forwarding rule
5. **Verify**: Confirm new certificate is working

### **Monitoring and Alerts**

#### Automated Monitoring
- Daily certificate status checks
- Email alerts for issues
- Health monitoring reports

#### Your Involvement
- **Minimal**: Most monitoring is automated
- **Alerts**: You'll be notified of any DNS-related issues
- **Renewals**: Coordination required only for renewals

## üîß Technical Details

### **DNS Configuration Details**

#### External DNS (GoDaddy)
- **Purpose**: Let's Encrypt certificate validation
- **Usage**: Only during certificate generation/renewal
- **TTL**: 1 hour for faster updates if needed

#### Internal DNS (Your Network)
- **Purpose**: Daily office access
- **Usage**: All regular user traffic
- **Benefit**: Keeps traffic internal, improves performance

### **Port Forwarding Details**

#### Security Considerations
- **Temporary**: Only enabled during certificate generation
- **Minimal Exposure**: Port 80 only, brief duration
- **Automated**: Process is scripted and monitored

#### Network Impact
- **Minimal**: 5-10 minutes quarterly
- **Scheduled**: Coordinated maintenance windows
- **Reversible**: Easy to enable/disable

## üîç Troubleshooting Guide

### **DNS Issues**

#### Problem: DNS record not resolving
**Solutions**:
1. Check GoDaddy DNS configuration
2. Verify TTL has expired (wait 1 hour)
3. Test with different DNS servers
4. Clear local DNS cache

#### Problem: Internal DNS conflicts
**Solutions**:
1. Verify internal DNS record is correct
2. Check DNS server priority/order
3. Test from different office devices
4. Restart DNS services if needed

### **Port Forwarding Issues**

#### Problem: Certificate generation fails
**Solutions**:
1. Verify port forwarding rule is active
2. Check firewall allows port 80 traffic
3. Confirm internal IP (192.168.0.100) is correct
4. Test port accessibility

#### Problem: Security concerns
**Solutions**:
1. Confirm port forwarding is disabled after use
2. Monitor firewall logs during process
3. Schedule during low-traffic periods
4. Document all changes
