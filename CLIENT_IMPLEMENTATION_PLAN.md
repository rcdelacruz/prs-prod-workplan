# üéØ Client Implementation Plan: prs.citylandcondo.com

## üìã Client Requirements Summary

Based on your responses:

‚úÖ **Domain**: `prs.citylandcondo.com`  
‚úÖ **DNS Provider**: GoDaddy (managed by Cityland IT network admin)  
‚úÖ **API Access**: NO (manual DNS management)  
‚úÖ **Internal DNS**: YES (with testing capability)  
‚úÖ **Certificate Renewal**: Automated preference  

## üöÄ Recommended Implementation Strategy

### **Primary Approach: Hybrid DNS + Automated SSL**

This combines the best of both worlds for your specific setup:

1. **External DNS** (GoDaddy): For Let's Encrypt certificate validation
2. **Internal DNS** (Your network): For day-to-day office access
3. **Automated SSL**: HTTP-01 challenge with minimal manual intervention

## üìã Implementation Steps

### **Phase 1: DNS Setup (Cityland IT Network Admin)**

#### Step 1.1: External DNS (GoDaddy)
```
Record Type: A
Name: prs
Value: [Your office public IP address]
TTL: 1 Hour
```

**Purpose**: Required for Let's Encrypt certificate validation only

#### Step 1.2: Internal DNS (Your Network)
```
Record Type: A
Name: prs.citylandcondo.com
Value: 192.168.0.100
```

**Purpose**: Daily office access (bypasses external routing)

### **Phase 2: SSL Automation Setup**

#### Step 2.1: Run Automated Setup
```bash
# Execute the complete setup wizard
sudo /opt/prs/prod-workplan/scripts/setup-custom-domain.sh
```

#### Step 2.2: Certificate Generation Process
The script will guide you through:
1. **Port Forwarding Setup** (temporary, for certificate generation)
2. **Certificate Generation** (automated via Let's Encrypt)
3. **Port Forwarding Removal** (security)
4. **Service Configuration** (nginx restart)

### **Phase 3: Testing & Validation**

#### Step 3.1: DNS Resolution Test
```bash
# Test external DNS (should resolve to public IP)
nslookup prs.citylandcondo.com 8.8.8.8

# Test internal DNS (should resolve to 192.168.0.100)
nslookup prs.citylandcondo.com
```

#### Step 3.2: Access Testing
```bash
# Test HTTPS access
curl -v https://prs.citylandcondo.com/health

# Verify SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect prs.citylandcondo.com:443 -servername prs.citylandcondo.com
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### **DNS Configuration Benefits**

#### External DNS (GoDaddy)
- **Purpose**: Let's Encrypt certificate validation
- **Frequency**: Used only during certificate generation/renewal
- **Management**: Cityland IT network admin (one-time setup)

#### Internal DNS (Your Network)
- **Purpose**: Daily office access
- **Frequency**: Used for all regular traffic
- **Management**: Your internal DNS server
- **Benefit**: Traffic stays internal, faster access

### **SSL Certificate Automation**

#### Certificate Generation (Every ~90 days)
1. **Notification**: Automated email alert 30 days before expiry
2. **Process**: 5-10 minute guided renewal
3. **Requirements**: Temporary port 80 forwarding
4. **Result**: New valid certificate installed

#### Daily Monitoring
- **Status Checks**: Automated at 2:00 AM
- **Health Monitoring**: Certificate validity and expiry tracking
- **Alerts**: Email notifications for any issues

## üìÖ Implementation Timeline

### **Day 1: DNS Setup (30 minutes)**
- [ ] **Cityland IT**: Create external DNS A record in GoDaddy
- [ ] **Your Team**: Configure internal DNS record
- [ ] **Test**: Verify both DNS resolutions work

### **Day 2: SSL Implementation (45 minutes)**
- [ ] **Run Setup Script**: Execute automated configuration
- [ ] **Port Forwarding**: Temporary setup for certificate generation
- [ ] **Certificate Generation**: Let's Encrypt validation and installation
- [ ] **Security**: Remove port forwarding
- [ ] **Testing**: Verify HTTPS access from office devices

### **Day 3: Validation & Training (30 minutes)**
- [ ] **Access Testing**: Test from multiple office devices
- [ ] **Monitoring Setup**: Verify automated monitoring is working
- [ ] **Team Training**: Brief IT team on renewal process
- [ ] **Documentation**: Review maintenance procedures

## üîÑ Operational Procedures

### **Quarterly Certificate Renewal**

When you receive renewal notification email:

#### Step 1: Preparation (2 minutes)
- Schedule brief maintenance window
- Notify users of potential 5-minute downtime

#### Step 2: Port Forwarding (2 minutes)
- **Cityland IT**: Temporarily enable port 80 forwarding
- Configuration: External Port 80 ‚Üí 192.168.0.100:80

#### Step 3: Renewal Execution (3 minutes)
```bash
sudo /opt/prs/scripts/ssl-automation-citylandcondo.sh renew
```

#### Step 4: Cleanup (2 minutes)
- **Cityland IT**: Disable port 80 forwarding
- **Verify**: Test HTTPS access

#### Step 5: Validation (1 minute)
```bash
sudo /opt/prs/scripts/ssl-renewal-monitor.sh check
```

### **Daily Operations (Automated)**
- Certificate monitoring
- Health checks
- Log rotation
- Status reporting

## üîê Security Considerations

### **Network Security**
- **Internal Traffic**: Stays on local network via internal DNS
- **External Access**: Only during certificate validation
- **Port Forwarding**: Temporary and minimal exposure

### **Certificate Security**
- **Valid SSL**: Industry-standard Let's Encrypt certificates
- **Automated Renewal**: Prevents expiration issues
- **Secure Storage**: Private keys protected with proper permissions

## üéØ Success Criteria

### **Immediate Goals**
- ‚úÖ `https://prs.citylandcondo.com` accessible from office
- ‚úÖ Valid SSL certificate (no browser warnings)
- ‚úÖ Automated monitoring operational
- ‚úÖ Internal DNS resolution working

### **Long-term Goals**
